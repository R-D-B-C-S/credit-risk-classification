## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:
The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a loan will be healthy or unhealthy depending on the features. For this anaysis we will be looking at loan size, interest rates, borrow income, debt to income ratios, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. There were 77536 total loans with 2500 of them being in default amounting to 0.03% of the loans and 75036 of them being healthy. To complete this machine learning model we seperated the target value from the features, created training data and test data and then we created and fit the model. For this model we used logistic regression.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.


* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * The accuracy of the model of 99%.
  * The precision for healthy loans is 100% and 85% for unhealthy loans
  * The recall score for healthy loans is 99% and 91% for unhealthy loans

* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * The accuracy of the model of 99%.
  * The precision for healthy loans is 100% and 84% for unhealthy loans
  * The recall score for healthy loans is 99% and 99% for unhealthy loans




## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:


Both models are incredibly accurate. However the second model is better for our purpose because it has similar results for all other factos and has better recall for unhealthy loans allowing us to predict dangerous loans that pose a financial risk.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
